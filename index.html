      I am Celia Pool, a consumer product and sustainability entrepreneur who builds ideas into real businesses.
      I co founded DAME, an award winning women’s health brand, and now focus on Business Edits, where I work with founders
      to sharpen thinking, strengthen strategy and build things that stand up in the real world.

  <!-- What I Do -->
  <section class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 py-20 border-t border-zinc-800">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mb-6">What I Do Now</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-4">Business Edits</h3>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Business Edits is my main focus. I work closely with founders, operators and small teams building consumer products,
      platforms or services who want to make better decisions earlier.
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The work is practical and collaborative. It often sits where things feel slightly stuck or fuzzy.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
      <li>Strategy and decision making</li>
      <li>Brand and narrative clarity</li>
      <li>Product and commercial thinking</li>
      <li>Structure, systems and priorities</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I bring an operator’s perspective shaped by building and running a venture backed consumer brand, owning P and L,
      managing teams and raising capital. I use AI daily to accelerate research, stress test ideas and improve execution,
      but judgement always comes first.
    </p>

    <p class="italic opacity-80 font-serif">
      “Tools change. Clear thinking still does the heavy lifting.”
    </p>

  <!-- DAME -->
  <section class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 py-20 border-t border-zinc-800">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mb-6">Selected Work</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-4">DAME</h3>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I co founded DAME to address two problems hiding in plain sight: poor design in women’s health products and the
      environmental cost of period care.
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      DAME created the world’s first reusable tampon applicator and built a global consumer brand around women’s health
      and sustainability.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
      <li>Launched via Kickstarter, exceeding the funding target by 600 percent</li>
      <li>Global press and product awards including Dezeen</li>
      <li>National retail listings with Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Boots, Ocado, Selfridges, ASOS and Next</li>
      <li>Reached 5 percent revenue share from Tampax within six months of launch in Waitrose</li>
      <li>Customers in more than 50 countries</li>
      <li>Ecommerce growth of 150 percent year on year</li>
      <li>Raised over £2m from angels, corporate venture capital, family offices and crowdfunding, with Sky as an early investor</li>
      <li>Early B Corp certification</li>
      <li>Prevented more than 20 million disposable applicators from entering landfill</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      Alongside the commercial work, I built and led the team, set strategy, managed culture, and owned company wide finance
      and P and L. I also founded DAMEchangers, an innovation camp for 16 to 17 year old girls at Oxford University, and
      represented the brand through public speaking, media and UK Government taskforces.

  <!-- How I Think -->
  <section class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 py-20 border-t border-zinc-800">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mb-6">How I Think</h2>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I am sceptical by default and optimistic by choice.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
      <li>Framing the right problem before chasing solutions</li>
      <li>Making complexity simpler without losing meaning</li>
      <li>Designing systems that last longer than enthusiasm</li>
      <li>Using evidence and numbers as allies, not threats</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I am comfortable changing my mind when something better shows up. Experience has taught me that confidence comes
      from learning fast, not pretending to know everything.
